INIT
====

A quick way to go to the first commit of a repo.

# Overview

Being able to quickly navigate to the oldest commit in a repo is quite helpful, so go ahead and drag the <a href="http://farhadg.github.io/init/index.html" target="_blank">bookmarklet (link)</a> onto your bookmark bar and click it whenever you'd like to go to the first commit of a repo.

# Usage

Go to any particular repo's landing page `(e.g. like the one you're on)` and click the bookmarklet, which will take you to the oldest repo. By default, it tracks the `master` branch, but if you change the `branch` on the landing page, it will go to that branch's first commit.

I'll probably build this into a browser extension soon, but for now, you can simply drag the bookmarklet to your bookmark bar and click it whenever you'd like.

# Coming

- Browser extension
- Better build process
- Support for BitBucket (others?)
